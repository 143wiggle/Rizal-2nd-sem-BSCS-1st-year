August 30, 1887 - Rizal met with Governor-General Emilio Terrero, a liberal-minded Spanish official; he agreed with rizal's, and found nothing wrong with the novel.

Archbishop of Manila at the time, Nozaleda, recommended that the importation, reproduction, distribution, and possession of the novel be stopped.


Terrero, concerned for Rizal's safety, assigned Lieutenant Jose Taviel de Andrade to protect him.

Terrero ordered an investigation on Calamba agrarian problem, and see if the conflict can be resolved peacefully.

Rizal was asked to lead the group of Calamba tenants.

He presented his findings to Terrero: Friars were exploiting the tenants and taking advantage of their poverty; the hacienda of the Dominican order comprised not only the lands around Calamba but the whole town of Calamba:

The hacienda of the Dominican order increased profit because of the arbitrary increase of the rentals paid by the tenants.

There was increased profit for the Dominican order because the hacienda owner never contributed for the celebration of the town fiesta for the education of the children and for the improvement of agriculture.

Tenants who spent more labor in clearing the lands were dispossessed of the said lands for a real reason.

For delayed payments of rentals, high rates of interest were charged to the tenants.

Work animals, tools, and farm implements of the tenants were confiscated by the hacienda management if the rentals were not paid by the tenants.

Friars were furious with Rizal's findings.

They demanded that Terrero order Rizal to leave the country.

Terrero refused, but he advised Rizal to leave for his own safety, and so did Rizal's family.

- Promote education, agriculture, and commerce.
- Study and implement reforms.

During his time in Hong Kong, Rizal wrote 2 articles:

To my countrymen - He expressed his own analysis of the agrarian issue in Calamba.

During his journey to Hong Kong from Marseilles, Rizal met William Pryer, managed the British North Borneo Company, which has a lease to oversee North Borneo.

Rizal heard Pryer's plan for the British colony; suggested creating a Filipino colony in North Borneo for the evicted Calamba tenants; Pryer liked the idea.

Together with Rizal, met with the governor of North Borneo, leasing at least 5,000 acres of land, with option to buy even more for 950 years.
 
But there was a problem - the Calamba tenants couldn't leave; need permission from the Spanish Governor-General, Eulogio Despujol.

Rizal wrote to Despujol; Despujol got angry and thought Rizal might use the Filipino colony in North Borneo to start a revolution against Spain.

Instead of replying directly, he asked the Spanish consul in Hong Kong to invite Rizal back to Manila to discuss the matter.

Rizal's family and friend advised him to decline Despujol's invitation, considering it a trap.
Rizal was resolute.
